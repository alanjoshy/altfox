# Products Section Removal from Homepage

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed from Section Loader (assets/js/load-sections.js)
**Before:**
```javascript
const sections = [
    { path: 'sections/hero-section.html', target: '#about-us-placeholder' },
    { path: 'sections/products-section.html', target: '#products-section-placeholder' }, // REMOVED
    { path: 'sections/industries-section.html', target: '#benefits-grid-placeholder' },
    ...
];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const sections = [
    { path: 'sections/hero-section.html', target: '#about-us-placeholder' },
    // Products section removed - users will be redirected to products page instead
    { path: 'sections/industries-section.html', target: '#benefits-grid-placeholder' },
    ...
];
```

### 2. Updated Solutions Section Button (sections/solutions-section.html)
**Before:**
```html
<a href="products.html">
    <button>Explore Products ↗</button>
</a>
```

**After:**
```html
<a href="pages/products.html">
    <button>Explore Products ↗</button>
</a>
```

### 3. Removed Products Section Placeholder (index.html)
**Before:**
```html
<!-- Products Section -->
<div id="products-section-placeholder"></div>
```

**After:**
```html
<!-- Removed - Products section no longer displayed on homepage -->
```

## Why This Change?



1. **Cleaner Homepage**: Removes product listing clutter
2. **Better Navigation**: Products have their own dedicated page
3. **Improved UX**: Clear call-to-action button redirects to products page
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Product details live on dedicated product pages

## New User Flow

**Before:**
- Homepage → Scroll down → See products inline → Click "Learn More" → Product page

**After:**
- Homepage → See "Explore Products" button → Click → Redirect to dedicated products page → Browse all products

## Benefits

✅ Cleaner, less cluttered homepage
✅ Clear separation of content
✅ Better call-to-action
✅ Dedicated products page for detailed browsing
✅ Improved page load times (one less section to load)
